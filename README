Here you are, so you successfully did "tar zxvf CMakeOpenWrtExamples.tar.gz"
or something similar.

This package demonstrates how you can build apps and libs (shared or static)
for an OpenWRT target with the CMake build system.
You also can build these apps and libs for the host system without changing
the buildfiles or the sources.

1. What you need

I don't know.
Today (01/11/2008) I use 2.6.23-gentoo-r3, gcc-4.1.2 and cmake-2.4.6-r1 

2. Build lib for host:

go to HelloCMakeLibMM/src/
./clean.sh
cmake .
make

2.1. Install lib on host:

sudo make install

libs will be installed in /usr/local/lib/
headers will be installed in /usr/local/include/libhellocmakemm/

2.2. Uninstall lib from host:

sudo make uninstall

3. Build app for host (lib needs to be build and installed on host):

go to HelloCMakeApp/src/
./clean.sh
cmake .
make

3.1. Install app on host:

sudo make install

app will be installed in /usr/local/bin/

3.2. Run app

hellocmakeapp

3.3. Uninstall app from host:

sudo make uninstall

4. Build lib for OpenWRT target:

symlink HelloCMakeLibMM in your OpenWRT/trunk/package/ dir
go to your OpenWRT/trunk/ dir
make menuconfig
select Libraries->libhellocmakemm as module
save and exit
make package/HelloCMakeLibMM-compile V=99

5. Build app for OpenWRT target:

symlink HelloCMakeApp in your OpenWRT/trunk/package/ dir
go to your OpenWRT/trunk/ dir
make menuconfig
select Utilities->hellocmakeapp as module
save and exit
make package/HelloCMakeApp-compile V=99

6. Install lib and app on router
You decide...
...fast hit: scp libs and app to router (not recommended, uclibcxx has
already to be installed on the router)
...my way:
go to OpenWRT/trunk/ dir
make package/index
cp bin/* /var/www/localhost/htdocs/openwrt/mips/9456/ -R (my apache home)
ssh or minicom to router
ipkg update (apache needs to be running on host and routers /etc/ipkg.conf needs to
point to it)
ipkg install hellocmakeapp (pulls deps in)

7. Run app on Router
hellocmakeapp
